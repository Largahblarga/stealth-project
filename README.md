# stealth-project
GM:S Project from over a year ago. Trying to start on it again and be organized about it.

This is from when I was in high school and frustrated that I couldn't install Unity. Now that I have a laptop and am not currently in college (for a couple months anyways) I'm going to be reviving this and working on it. Technically this is private but I'm a cheap bastard. pls no copypasterino.
